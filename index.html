      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>The process begins with Step 1: Dashboard Overview, where the user lands on the main screen displaying their profile details and an overview of today's ride. Key features on this screen include a search bar for navigation or filtering, a ride summary showing route details, estimated time of arrival, and the time remaining for the driver's arrival.</p> 
        <p>Moving to Step 2: Enter Destination, the user selects or enters their destination on the "Enter Your Destination" screen. They can choose their current location ("My Location"), specific addresses or streets ( "Folsom St."), or a list of recent destinations for quicker selection. Finally, in Step 3: Booking Confirmation, after confirming the destination, the user proceeds to book their ride. A success screen displays the message: "You have successfully booked a Ride," accompanied by a friendly note at the bottom: "Have a nice Travel."</p>
